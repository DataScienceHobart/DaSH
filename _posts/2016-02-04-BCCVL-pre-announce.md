Hi DaSHers, 

This week (5 February 2016) we have an open session, as announced on the [new DaSH blog](http://datasciencehobart.github.io/2016/02/03/DaSH-5-February.html). 


This post is to provide an early announcement of next week, when we have a special session on **Species Distribution Modelling made easy.**

Sarah Richmond, of [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/)  and the [Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL)](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-excellence/climate-resilient-decision-support-toolkit/the-biodiversity-and-climate-change-virtual-laboratory) is visiting us and will give us a hands-on demonstration of some of the features of the BCCVL. The BCCVL simplifies the process of biodiversity-climate change modelling. It integrates a suite of tools in an online environment where researchers can access data and perform data analysis and modelling.


*When*:  from 0900 to 1030 (for a 0915 start)

*Where*: the ground floor teaching lab at [IMAS / ACE CRC Salamanca (‘the Waterfront’)](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Antarctic+Climate+%26+Ecosystems+CRC/@-42.8864995,147.3332809,17.25z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x6643069d32752fb7). 


This demonstration will cater for those interested in using the features of the BCCVL (biodiversity, climate change) as well as those who want to understand more about how a 'Virtual Laboratory' can enable and speed up research.

 Bring your laptop, and join this hands-on demonstration on Friday 12 February at 9:15 in the Teaching Lab, ground floor  at IMAS Salamanca.
