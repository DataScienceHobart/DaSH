**About**

This blog is a resource for members of the Data Science Hobart community.  Here you will find seminar and conference announcements, news and tutorial articles,  guides to tools and even some case studies and other resources pertaining to data science and analysis.

Hobart has the highest number of scientists per capita of any city in Australia. We all use data and we can all learn from each other.

The idea behind this is to build a community of scientists, programmers, data monkeys, and hackers that meet regularly, in Hobart, to discuss data, concepts, tools, methods, and to solve problems. This group will try to be programming language independent – feel free to talk about what ever you like – including R, Matlab, Python, Java, Excel or whatever you happen to use.



*Where*

This group is open to all and our meetings are usually held in the IMAS Waterfront Building, 20 Castray Esplanade, Battery Point

*When*

Friday mornings 0915hrs to 1015hrs.
