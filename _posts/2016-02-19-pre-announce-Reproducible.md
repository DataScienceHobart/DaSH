Hi DaSHers, 
 
*This week we had a discussion about general problems with data accessiblity and know-how, and strategies for helping
out our research communities to get their work done more efficiently. The general consensus is to promote community 
educational activities and best practice like DaSH and [Software Carpentry](http://www.softwarecarpentry.org/) and reproducible research.*




## Upcoming session - 26 February 2016

Next week we have Damien Irving from CSIRO giving a presentation on *reproducible research*:   

*How to write a reproducible paper*

Damien Irving, 
Postdoctoral Fellow, 
CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere 

Atmosphere and ocean science has undergone a computational revolution in recent decades, to the point where all modern research relies heavily on software and code. Despite this profound change in the research methods employed by scientists, the reporting of computational results has changed very little in academic journals. This lag has led to something of a reproducibility crisis, whereby it is impossible to replicate and verify most of today's published computational results. While it is tempting to decry the slow response of journals and funding agencies in the face of this crisis, there are very few examples of reproducible research upon which to base new communication standards. In an attempt to address this deficiency, this talk will describe a procedure for reporting computational results that was employed in a recent Journal of Climate paper. The procedure was developed to be consistent with recommended computational best practices and seeks to minimise the time burden on authors, which has been identified as the most important barrier to publishing code. It should provide a starting point for atmosphere and ocean scientists looking to publish reproducible research, and it is proposed that journals could adopt the procedure as a formal minimum standard.


*When*:  from 0915 to 1015, 26 February 2016
 
*Where*: Flex space, on the ground floor at IMAS
