Hi DaSHers, 

Today we had a wide ranging discussion which meandered around two main themes:  colour blind friendly figures; and good practice programming.

**Colour blind friendly figure**
Over the last few weeks, Tom has been investigating how to simplify making figures colourblind friendly. He brought a few simple solutions.  Although it is very easy to chose and set colour blind friendly colours/paletts, knowng how and where to find them is tricky depending on the platform/program you are in.  So here is a rainbow range:

 | hexcode | normalname | designername
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | #000000 | colourblindblack | black
2 | #999999 | colourblindgrey | dustygrey
3 | #0072B2 | colourblinddarkblue | deepcerulean
4 | #56B4E9 | colourblindlightblue | pictonblue
5 | #009E73 | colourblindgreen | greenhaze
6 | #F0E442 | colourblindyellow | starship
7 | #E69F00 | colourblindorange | orangepeel
8 | #D55E00 | colourblindred | tenn
9 | #CC79A7 | colourblindpink | hopbush

One of the biggest challenges was finding a way to check how an entire image looked with a particular kind of colour blindness.  The app 'Color Oracle' (http://colororacle.org/) provided a free, simple, easy, rapid, cross platform solution. It just changes the screen colour palette temporaily, allowing a quick check.  
Here are three different checks of the original image.

**Good Practice Programming**
A number of issues were discussed around good practice programming including: script design; including tests; memory management; efficiency testing and overall profiling of code performance, debugging. Mike and Damien provided links to various resources throughout the discussion to help support the discussion.  These are:
