Hi DaSHers, 
 
*Last week we had an excellent hands-on demonstration of the [Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL)](https://www.griffith.edu.au/research/research-excellence/climate-resilient-decision-support-toolkit/the-biodiversity-and-climate-change-virtual-laboratory) by Sarah Richmond, of [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/). The session was well-attended and discussions continued on past our allotted time and into the cafe. Thanks very much to Sarah for the presentation.*


This week (19 February 2016) is an open session - please come along with any questions or stories you have. The bookings are a bit fluid, so DaSH might be in the flex room, seminar theatre, or upstairs in the lunch room, will tweet last minute details  [DataScienceHbt](https://twitter.com/DataScienceHbt/). 

 
*When*:  from 0915 to 1015 
 
*Where*: the ground floor at IMAS
