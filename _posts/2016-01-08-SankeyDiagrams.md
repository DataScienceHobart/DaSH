## First meeting 2016!

Today was *very* informal with Indi, Mike and Reg talking about [Sankey Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram). We looked at [Mike Bostock's D3 tools](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/sankey/) and the inevitable R wrapper for that in the [networkD3 package](https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/). 

Reg really wants to export a diagram to SVG or similar vector format, but none of us had any idea on how to do that. 

Indi also pointed out the [Tableau Desktop](http://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) which looks cool. 

See you next week, Flex Room IMAS building Fridays 0915.
