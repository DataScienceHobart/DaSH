Hi DaSHers, 

**LAST WEEK**

*Last week, Pearse gave a great talk on Iris and Cartopy, explaining their major advantages and disadvantages.*  

*They are great packages for standardised mapping and highly recommended a look by python users, especially entry level users as they offer some wonderful in-built maps that are easily accessible, with many projections available. It is also very easy to add your own points, transects and polygons to these maps.*  

*Discussion meandered around the versatility of the packages.  To major topics were import/export of data in/out of these packages.  As they are designed for use with datasets that are CF compliant (ie. Climate and Forecast conventions for metadata), using non-CF compliant datasets can be more hassle than the benefits offered.  Also, it was recommended as both Iris and Cartopy be best used as a final step towards producing a publication quality figures (ie. exporting figure formats), rather than using the tools inside for data analysis (ie. exporting summary grids), as getting the data out again can be problematic, so there are better more straight forward and versatile tools for that.*

*Thanks again to Pearse for the intro and review of these packages.*
