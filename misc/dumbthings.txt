##Examples of traps

## apologies to Paul Kelly 

o Floating point traps

.1 == .3 / 3.0

(Some syntax will depend on the language, but python and R give the same answer for that code)

o Missing data traps

equality with "missing", e.g. 

x == NA
x == null

o NA is not NA_real_

x <- 1:10
x[3] <- NA  ## !!!

R has NULL, NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf, and ""

o   case-sensitive traps, e.g. code rules are different to data rules:

sEleCT nAME frOm tab; -- this is fine 

select instr(name, "a") from tab; -- returns 6 for William, 2 for Sam, but 0 for Anderson

o degenerate array dimensions 

## R
mat[ , 1:2] ## is a matrix
mat[,2] ## is a vector

squeeze(etc) for matlab

o changing code incompletely, and getting trapped by insufficient testing

## version 1
mat <- matrix(1, 2)
a <- mat[2]
a * 3

## version 2
imat <- matrix(1, 2)  ## rename variable
a <- mat[2]   ## but forget to rename it here
a * 3   ## obstusely gives no error in the same session, fails in new session 

o integer division (nuff said)

o matlab's m1 * m2 is R's m1 %*% m2, R's m1 * m2 is matlab's m1 .* m2
