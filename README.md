## How to post

1. Clone this repo. 
2. Make your edits, say by creating a .md file in _posts/ (see below)
3. Push your edits if you have the privileges, or create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). 

### Simple Markdown 

The simplest method is to create a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file (.md) in the _posts/ directory. 

The format of the name must follow the pattern of "YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md". 

A minimal blog post consists of the following Markdown content

```
---
layout: post
title: "DaSH whatever and ever amen"
author: "Rupert Rabbit"
date: "2816-02-05"
published: true
status: publish
draft: false
